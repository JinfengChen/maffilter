MafFilter is a program dedicated to the analysis of genome alignments. It parses and manipulates [MAF files](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format5) as well as more simple fasta files. Despite various filtering options and format conversion tools, MafFilter can compute a wide range of statistics (phylogenetic trees, nucleotide diversity, inferrence of selection, etc.)

MafFilter is built using the [Bio++ libraries](http://biopp.univ-montp2.fr), as well as the boost iostream library for handling of compressed files. [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=maffilter&searchon=names&suite=stable&section=all) and [RPM](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jdutheil:/Bio++2.3.0/) packages are available.
